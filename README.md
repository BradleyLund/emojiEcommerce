My display of a concept online store with full shopping cart functionality selling emoji's as NFT's using bootstrap 4.

You can see a live version of the website here: https://bradleylund.github.io/emojiEcommerce/

## Installation

Just clone the repository and open the index.html file with your browser and everything should work from there!

## Usage

### Home Page

There is the structure of an auction type sale of the emoji NFT with fictitious bids.
Unfortunately it is not functional at this point in time.

On the bottom of the home page there are some fake reviews from famous people who bought their most relevant emoji as an NFT.

### About Us Page

This is just a classic about us page you might have on any store website. It also contains some links to more information on NFT's and the layout for a feedback form.
